Teleport to a Random Island!

Very small mod to randomly teleport to other islands.

Currently it's hard coded to be a random number between -20000 to 20000 for both X & Y coords.

In a future patch I'll make it adjustable.

Includes:
- 30s cooldown between teleports
- Completely random -20000 to 20000 teleports
- Confirmation message, run command again to confirm and teleport.
